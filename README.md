## Project Overview
This project aims to **streamline e-commerce transactions** by replacing manual transaction management methods (such as Excel spreadsheets) with a **specialized database solution**. The proposed system **improves accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and security**, ensuring that businesses can efficiently manage high transaction volumes.

---

## Abstract
E-commerce businesses rely heavily on **effective transaction management** to sustain growth. This project introduces a **robust database solution** to replace outdated manual systems, enabling **faster, more accurate, and data-driven** decision-making. The system helps **e-commerce managers, customer service teams, financial experts, and marketing analysts** efficiently track transactions and derive insights.

---

## Problem Statement
The reliance on **manual methods** for handling transactional data results in:
- **Human errors** affecting business operations.
- **Slow processing times** impacting customer experience.
- **Limited scalability** due to inefficient data handling.
- **Lack of real-time insights** for decision-making.

This project seeks to answer:
1. How can a database **improve transaction management** compared to spreadsheets?
2. What features and functionalities should a transaction database include?
3. What are the **benefits of shifting to a dedicated database**?

---

## Background and Significance
Many businesses still use **Excel-based transaction management**, which is **error-prone and inefficient**. With the **growth of e-commerce**, businesses require **real-time transaction processing, fraud detection, and seamless scalability**. A **well-designed database** addresses these challenges by **automating transaction handling, reducing errors, and improving performance**.

---

## Potential Contribution and Importance
A **centralized transaction database** can:
- **Enhance efficiency** by automating data management.
- **Reduce errors** and improve accuracy.
- **Enable real-time insights** for decision-making.
- **Improve security** with authentication and access controls.
- **Support scalability** to handle large transaction volumes.

---

## Target Users and Administration
The **primary users** include:
- **E-commerce managers** for monitoring transactions.
- **Customer support teams** for resolving transaction-related issues.
- **Finance professionals** for auditing and financial reporting.
- **Marketing analysts** for analyzing transaction patterns.

**Database administrators** manage the system, ensuring **data integrity, performance, and security**.

## Entity-Relationship (E/R) Diagram
The system consists of two E/R models:
1. **Crow’s Foot Notation**  
2. **Chen’s Notation**

These diagrams illustrate how **users, transactions, merchants, and banks** interact within the database.

---

## Relation Schema
Key database tables include:
1. **Status Table** - Tracks the status of transactions.
2. **User Table** - Stores user details.
3. **Bank Table** - Maintains bank records.
4. **UserCard Table** - Links users to their payment cards.
5. **Merchant Table** - Stores merchant details.
6. **MerchantServiceMapping Table** - Maps merchants to their services.
7. **UserTransaction Table** - Stores customer transactions.
8. **MerchantTransaction Table** - Stores merchant transactions.
9. **PaymentType Table** - Defines accepted payment methods.
10. **OTP Table** - Stores OTP authentication data.

Each table follows **relational constraints and normalization principles** to ensure **data integrity and efficiency**.

---

## Normalization (BCNF)
All tables have been **fully normalized to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** to:
- Eliminate **data redundancy**.
- Ensure **data integrity**.
- Optimize **database performance**.

Each relation has been **decomposed and analyzed** to confirm BCNF compliance.

---

## Indexing
To **enhance query performance**, indexing is applied to frequently accessed tables:

### Example Indexes:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_transaction_email_payment_status 
ON UserTransaction (EmailId, PaymentTypeId, StatusId);

CREATE INDEX idx_merchant_transactions_email_payment_status 
ON MerchantTransactions (EmailId, PaymentTypeId, StatusId);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_card_email_card_number 
ON UserCard (EmailId, CardNumber);
